The mixture cure rate model is widely used to model lifetime data with cure fraction. 
The goal of this project is to model survival data with cure fraction using decision trees-based EM algorithm.
Section A1 in the supporting materials page contains the R code used for the data generation in Section 4.
Section A2 in the supporting materials page also contains the R code for the DT-based EM algorithm in Section 4.
In section 1 of the main paper we present a brief introduction of the topic of interest.
Section 2 in the main paper discuss the decision trees-based mixture cure rate model.
In sections 3 of the main paper we illustrate the estimation method (Expectation Maximization algorithm) employed in the study.
In section 4, we presented an extensive simulation study.
In section 5, we present an application of the proposed decision trees-based mixture cure model and the EM-based estimation algorithm to a data from a study on leukemia patients who went throughbone marrow transplantation (Copelan et al., 1991)
Section 6 contains the discussions, conclusions and future works.
